# ISD Inventory System

The ISD Inventory System project represents a small R&D project, having the main scope to investigate the opportunities of mobile domain and communication. As a result the project team should deliver a fully functional product, which can represent a good overview of a distributed application. 
The project itself represents a distributed system that has as main scope to automatize inventory process in an office. In short, a small server will collect scanned barcodes over intra-network from web flow or a mobile application which will later use this data to generate some reports about scanned goods.
